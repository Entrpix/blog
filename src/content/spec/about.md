# Hi, I'm Scaratek!
I'm a 14 year-old developer that mainly works with Javascript.\
I mainly do web development but I'm also interested in Chromebooks.\
I know Python 3, Bash, JS & TS, and Java (*kinda*).

I also like to host things!\
Currently I don't really have anything hosted buttt I'm hoping that will change soon!

I also **love** Linux!\
I mainly work with Debian (on servers) and Arch (on desktops)

I also really **LOVE** vocaloid.\
My favorite VA is Hatsune Miku.\
I enjoy both JP & EN (as well as covers).\
Since were talking about I may as well mention that I also really enjoy watching Hololive! (my gf got me into it)\
My oshi is Gigi Murin :3

While I don't play many video games I definitely play some.\
My favorites are Minecraft, Geometry Dash, Celeste, Hollow Knight, Staredew Valley, Animal Crossing New Horizons, Omori, and Osu! Mania (4k).\
Fun fact I actually have 2.4k~ hours in Geometry Dash, don't ask me why I don't know......

Thats about it bai bai :D
